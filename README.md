# Simulated Stock Market Price Index
## By James Hill
## Purpose:
## This Python script simulates changes in a stock market price index over the course of one quarter (63 working days). It generates random fluctuations in the index value and visualizes the results using Matplotlib.

## How to Use
### Clone the Repository:
####Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

### Install Dependencies:
#### Make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them via pip:

### Copy code
#### pip install matplotlib
#### Run the Script:
#### Run the stock_market_simulation.py script. It will simulate changes in the stock market price index and display the results using Matplotlib.

### Copy code
#### python stock_market_simulation.py
#### View Results:
#### The script will generate a plot showing the simulated changes in the price index over the course of one quarter (63 working days).

### Interpretation:

#### The x-axis represents the working days.
#### The y-axis represents the price index in USD.
#### The plot shows the fluctuation in the price index over time.
#### Exit:
#### Close the plot window to exit the program.

### Dependencies
#### Matplotlib: This library is used to generate plots and visualize the simulated data.
#### Note
#### This simulation is for educational purposes and does not reflect real-world stock market behavior.
#### Each time you run the script, it will generate a new simulation with random fluctuations.
#### You can modify the simulation parameters or the code itself to customize the behavior or add more features.
